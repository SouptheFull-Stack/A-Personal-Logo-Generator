# A-Personal-Logo-Generator

## Description
This project will be a tool for generating SVG logos using a simple Node.js application and the inquirer package.

## Installation
This uses Node.Js, so you will need to download it via this link. https://nodejs.org/en/download

Once you have Node, navigate to the root directory of this application in your terminal (I personally use VScode and copy the file path).
Run this command to initialise JSON packages (-y automatically skips through the manual download choices): npm init -y
Install the inquirer dependency for version 8.2.4: npm install inquirer@8.2.4

## Usage
Below is a video tutorial of the application usage:

Once you have installed all programs and dependencies, you just need to navigate to the root directory in your terminal again, and initialise it with: node 'filename'.js. In this instance, I have named my file index.js, so my command would be: node index.js. Once you complete the prompts provided, if successful, it will generate a logo.svg within the dist folder directory.
